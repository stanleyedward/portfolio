## About me

Student with unsatiated hunger to advance in the field of **deep learning**, looking to specialize in **computer vision and graphics**. Trying to get familiar with **3D reconstuction and view synthesis**. Always excited to help people and listen to people with similar interests.

Finds zen staring at decrementing loss counters while listening to korn.
